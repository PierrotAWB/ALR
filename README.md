## Dotfiles

The dotfiles I use on Linux. 

This repository includes configuration files for:
  - vim (text editor)
  - zsh (shell)
  - i3wm/i3-gaps (window manager)
  - polybar (status bar)
  - ranger (file manager)
  - compton (X11 compositor)
  - Neomutt (email client)
  - Calcurse (terminal calendar utility)

It contains also the scripts that some of these programs use.

Finally, it contains a fork of LukeSmith's st (Suckless terminal emulator) build.


### Current work
Right now, I'm doing some spring cleaning of my home (~/, that is), migrating from `~` to `~/.config/` where possible.

### Plans
- Newsboat (RSS feed)
- Create an installation script for these dotfiles.
